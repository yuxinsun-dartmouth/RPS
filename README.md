# RPS

## Simulation step 
let rule 1 be P(DSU|WTL) and rule 2 be P(RPS|RPS). Assume the emission matrix under the two rules are
Q1 = [[0.1, 0.8, 0.1],
      [1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
      [0.2, 0.1, 0.7]]
and Q2 = [[1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
      [1/3, 1/3, 1/3],
      [1/3, 1/3, 1/3]] 
respectively, and the transition matrix between the two rules is 
P = [[0.9, 0.1],
        [0.9, 0.1]]. We also assume AI is playing RPS randomly at equal probability in each game. Under such assumptions, we can simulate a number of games. 
The result of the simulation is shown in
